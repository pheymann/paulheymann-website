One of my hobbies is to run around with my camera. I find it to be an almost meditative exercise and it forces me to be more aware of my surroundings.

Currently, I use an *Olympys* MD OMD 10 Mark iii and a *14-150mm* travel lense. By the way, all my images are release under [Create Commons BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) lincence.
