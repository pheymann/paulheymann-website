He is the beast of chaos living deep within.

A marriage to hope and fear<br/>
That it may not sleep forever.<br/>
You pushed yourself too hard,<br/>
Lost your reign,<br/>
And now look at its rearing head.

Out of order.

Breaking through understanding,<br/>
Ripping it apart,<br/>
losing knowing altogether.

Swallowing you alive,<br/>
Flooding your world with chaos,<br/>
And for that, you pay a bitter price.
