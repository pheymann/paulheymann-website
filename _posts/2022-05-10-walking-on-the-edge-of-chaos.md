Chaos is where our inner world stops to exists. It is where we have to lift the fog and discover truth, boundless joy and endless suffering.

Chaos is where we learn what it means to be human.

Most of us shy away from that edge between the known and unknown. Some even pretend that it doesn’t exist. Only a few of us venture and walk the line, make the leap and immerse themselves into what isn’t yet.

Venturer, they push themselves beyond their inner world. They push their bodies beyond what it has done before. They push their understanding into the unknown. Learn for the rest of us, venturer, and be brave.

Some of us get sucked into Chaos. No choice. Charybdis is thrashing, gripping, pulling us into the abyss. Severing us mentally, physically beyond recognition. Maybe we get hold of the edge. Just one finger. Hold on to it. Get back to the edge of Chaos. Tell us what you have seen. Render Chaos to order.

Some of us get lost. Disappearing and do not return.

It is those who venture, it is those who suffer, that walk the edge of Chaos who expand what they know and through that bring order. Embrace them. Pity them. Learn from them. Learn for yourself. Make yourself uncomfortable. What is next? You don’t know. And in that process, find joy, suffering and a more complete image of yourself.

Learn from others who made the leap. Suffer with those who had no choice. Read their stories. They learned for you. Take their order and make it yours.

Do not fall behind. Do not stay where it is known. Chaos doesn’t stop, it will come around. We push on, go forward, leap, but for that we have to sacrifice what we have discovered before. Truths become lies, not valuable anymore. Stay and Chaos will move its edge towards you, beyond you and you will be caught by Charybdis.

Move on, venture on. Become and stay human.
