Chaos is where our inner world stops existing. It is truth not yet uncovered. 

Chaos is an endless source of joy and boundless suffering.

Chaos is where we learn what it means to be human. Most of us shy away from that ledge between the known and unknown, some even pretend that it doesn’t exist. Few of us venture on, do not hesitate, and walk that line. They make the leap and immerse themselves in what isn’t yet.

Venturers, they push themselves beyond their inner world. They push their bodies beyond what it has done before, beyond what any other human has done before. They push their understanding into the unknown, learn about themselves, and may even return.

But sometimes Charybdis is gripping and pulling them into the abyss severing them mentally, and physically beyond recognition. Maybe they get hold of the ledge with just one finger. Hold on to it. Fight and get back to the edge of chaos. Tell us what you have seen. Render chaos to order.

Some get lost forever.

It is those who venture and suffer that walk the edge of chaos. Embrace them. Pity them. Learn from them. Learn for yourself. Make yourself uncomfortable and find joy and a more complete image of yourself in that process.

And never fall behind. Do not stay where you name all things. Chaos doesn’t stop, it will come for you. We push on, go forward, and leap, but for that, we have to sacrifice what we have discovered before. Truths become lies, not valuable anymore. Stay and chaos will move its ledge towards you, beyond you and you will be caught by Charybdis.

Move on, venture on. Become and stay human.
