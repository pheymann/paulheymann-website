As far back as my memory reaches as far back I see books. I remember being (more than once) an irritation to others by taking a book about fusion reactors to the beach in the spring when my family visited the eastern sea. Or sitting in my room at home and reading about the Peloponnesian War when other kids watched TV.

Books always accompany me, they enrich my life, and so I thought: Why not share some of their names so other people might enjoy them too? That is what this page is all about. It is a collection of titles in no particular order but with some rough classifications.

But more than that this page also holds a list of books I still want to read. In some sense my digital antilibrary.

## Essentials
They are essential to me. They changed how I see the world and how I operate as a human being.

* A Treatise of Human Nature; David Hume, 1739
* Meditations; Marcus Aurelius, 161-180
* The Wealth of Nations; Adam Smith, 1776
* Crime and Punishment; Fyodor Dostoyevsky, 1866
* War and Peace; Leo Tolstoy, 1865
* Debt - The first 5000 years; David Graeber, 2011
* Bible
* How to read a book; Mortimer J. Adler, 1972

## Well Rounded
Some I like. With some, I disagree. Some are a slug to read. But not having read them would have been a net negative.

* Trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen (Man‚Äôs search for meaning); Viktor Frankl, 1946
* Siddharta; Hermann Hesse, 1922
* Brave new World; Aldous Huxley, 1931
* The Stranger; Albert Camus, 1942
* Republic; Plato, 375 BCE
* The Count of Monte Cristo; Alexandre Dumas, 1844
* The Brothers Karamazov; Fyodor Dostroyevsky, 1879
* The Idiot, Fyodor Dostroyevsky, 1868
* The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; Mark Twain, 1884
* 1984; George Orwell, 1949
* Iliad; Homer, 8th century BC
* The Odyssey; Homer, 8th century BCE
* Mrs. Dalloway; Virgina Woolf, 1925
* Animal Farm; George Orwell, 1945
* Solaris; Stanislaw Lem, 1961
* The old man and the sea; Enerst Hemingway, 1952
* The Black Swan; Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2007
* Consolations; David Whyte, 2014
* Histories; Herodotus, 340 BCE
* Romeo and Juliet; William Shakespear, 1597
* Hamlet; William Sharespear, 1599
* Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis); Franz Kafka, 1912
* In der Strafkolonie (In the Penal Colony); Franz Kafka, 1919
* Kabale und Liebe (Intrigue and Love); Friedrich Schiller, 1784
* Faust; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 1772
* The Futurological Congress; Stanislaw Lem, 1971
* An Anthropologiest on Mars; Oliver Sacks, 1995
* What‚Äôs our Problem? A Self-Help Book for Societies; Tim Urban, 2023

## Just plain fun
Not every story changes how I see the world. Some just bring me joy. They carry me to a foreign place or let me have a break. They are a small vacation.

* The Lord of the Rings; J.R.R. Tolkien, 1954
  * The Fellowship of the Ring
  * The Two Towers
  * The Return of the King
* Foundation Cycle; Isaac Asimov
  * Foundation; 1951
  * Foundation and Empire; 1952
  * Second Foundation; 1953
* Pride and Prejudice; Jane Austen, 1813

## Didn‚Äôt age well
While publicly celebrated I find their value questionable.

* Sapiens; Yuval Noah Harari, 2011
  * *There is academic critique going around about this book (see [here](https://aipavilion.github.io/docs/hallpike-review.pdf) for an example).*
* Thinking, Fast and Slow; Daniel Kahnemann, 2011
  * *Some experimental results enumerated in his book are [proven wrong](https://replicationindex.com/2020/12/30/a-meta-scientific-perspective-on-thinking-fast-and-slow/) by now. Besides that, I always compare his book to Hume‚Äôs Magnus Opus which isn‚Äôt particularly fair but still strikes me as astonishing that Hume uncovered many of the insights shared in Kahnemann‚Äôs book. But Hume did so already hundreds of years ago. So what I am left with is a book that stands on a shaky scientific foundation and provides me with insights that have been known for a long time.*

## Antilibrary
A list of my literary and academic blind spots. Books I haven‚Äôt read (yet). This list has only one goal: always be longer than all the lists above combined. My antilibrary should stay true to Aristotle‚Äôs exclamation *‚ÄùThe more you know, the more you realize you don't know‚Äù*.
