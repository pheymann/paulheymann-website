To believe means accepting a mystery, making it a tenet, and acting out its consequences. 

To believe means to build a bridge between the unknowable and understanding and through that expand oneself beyond what was possible before. 

To believe is the work of separating mystery from ignorance.

To believe is the hope that all this is true.
