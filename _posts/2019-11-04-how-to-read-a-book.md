Finally, after ignoring my website for almost a year I came around to write down another post. The reason is my discovery of Mortimer Adler's book [How to read a Book]() and the implication it had on the way I acquire knowledge.

For the impatient reader, there is a bare bones, highly condensed summary of, what I considered, the essence of the book itself and some personal highlights [below]().

### Origin story

I stumbled upon this gem during the 2019 [Scala World Conference](). Which is not to say that I was bored and needed something else to do, but I was skimming through [Hacker News]() during a break and ended up in a comment section of a post where it was mentioned. As always, for me, the comments of that website often provide more interesting information than the actual post.

But the mere discovery of the book itself wouldn't usually make me search for, download and read it within the same day. What was persuading me was the promise to:

*Gain as much knowledge out of a book as possible by applying an algorithm.*

That promise appealed to me, because of two main reasons:

  - My brain likes simple, deterministic rules and processes to split up and work on tasks. Might be a side effect of my job.
  - Before, I often had the impression of not really understanding the content of non-fiction books I read and I forgot most of the content shortly after. And when I put the time into learning something new I usually have the aspiration to understand and remember it.

## My previous reading style

The reason I experienced the problems described above are mainly caused by my previous reading style. I would read through a book as fast as I can, just to increase the throughput. In the end, time is limited and there are so many interesting topics to learn about. I tried to take notes from time to time, but it wasn't a fully fleshed out but simple to follow process.

What I was left with was a temporarily memory of snippets of the books I read and partial and probably also temporal understanding.

## What Mortimer Adler thinks about reading books

Luckily, Mortimer Adler developed a strategy for exactly that use case, of reading books for knowledge gain, or enlightment as he would call it.
