Hullo,<br/>
by random chance or by explicitly searching for it you ended up in my small digital domain. I am Paul Heymann a Software Engineer from Germany who works for the social network <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Paul_Heymann">Xing</a>. Here, I collect some of my thoughts about Computer Science, Economics, Teaching, and whatever interests me. These topics coincidentally also overlap with my skills and work experiences which you can find in my <a href="/cv">cv</a>.
