  <blockquote>
    What does it mean to live a good and fulfilling life? For the largest part of mine, I was completely ignorant of that question. I was pulled along a path I didn’t choose by forces I didn’t understand. I set money and titles as the central goals and believed that with the next achievement I would be happy and free of any worries. I was dedicated and driven. When everyone else went to parties in university I continued studying. When everyone went home after work and had a social life I continued working. And it paid off. I collected academic titles and earned increasingly more money. But nothing actually changed. Everything was just a new baseline and I was still not happy or free. Not even the birth of my first child changed that. It made it even worse because new worries were added on top of the old ones. After years along this bitter path finally, my mind rebelled and collapsed. Chaos encompassed me all of a sudden and from one day to the next there was nothing left for me but debilitating anxiety.
    <br>
    <br>
    During that time of chaos, I enamored myself with discipline and a patchwork of principles that let me wage war against myself, against my mind and body, to extinguish the dragon within me. They were the weapons and armor I used to finally gain victory. But luckily war was eventually over and these tools I choose reached the end of their usefulness. I could also not go back to the principles I followed before. I realized that I was driven by a deeply ingrained lack of self-esteem which made me worry, fear, and reach for external validation. I knew nothing of that was right for me and so I had to face the question: What actually makes a good life?

    That question I pose in my first article is the driving force behind this series. I try to uncover what it means when I talk about truth and how it is embedded in reality and ultimately which truths lead to a good life. This will be a long journey for me because my mind requires a fundamental understanding and I lack so much of it. Partially I can learn it from others. Partially I have to work it out myself always hoping that I do not run astray. Or when I do that I realize it in time and correct the course. And I know I will make mistakes because the topics I cover bring me to the limits of my mental abilities.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>What are those topics I managed to cover so far?</i>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-08-29-reality-truth-and-the-good-life %}">Reality, Truth, and the Good Life</a> - The general introduction to this series. It is also here that I set the general course. I will start from the bottom which means I need to figure out what reality is before I can establish truth. It is also here that I discover experience as the only objective truth as of now.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-08-29-what-is-me %}">What is "me"?</a> - A small, not completely fleshed-out detour on what makes “me”.
    
      <ul>
        <li><a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-09-22-objects-relations-and-how-reality-emerges %}">Objects, relations, and how reality emerges</a> The foundation of how reality comes about in my mind ...</li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-10-08-flaw-I-have-to-rethink-reality-and-ontology %}">Flaw: I have to rethink reality and ontology</a> - ... which I immediately had to correct because I was led astray by a deeply engrained assumption about biological workings and the need for a bottom-up approach to how reality is coming about.</li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-10-09-experienced-space-and-embodied-extension %}">Experienced space and embodied extension</a> - How is the experience of space emerging when the only thing I have is experience itself?</li>
        <li><a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-11-16-separation-ontology-impressions-through-articulation %}">Experience: Separation of Ontology and Impressions through Articulation</a> - Detailing out the difference between understanding and impressions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
    <i>What comes next?</i>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Experienced time</li>
    <li>Memory</li>
    <li>Causation</li>
    <li>What are feelings?</li>
    <li>How does the imagination work?</li>
    <li>Acting in this world</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
  By now, I should have a good enough understanding of experienced reality to work out how truths exist within it, especially those which guide human existence.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Relation of empirical observations and a pure conscious experience.</li>
    <li>What it means to die.</li>
    <li>Decision-making and free will.</li>
    <li>What exactly is objectively true here?</li>
    <li>What is good?</li>
    <li>Where to find truths that lead to a good life?\</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
    Whom do I have to convince? Only me. I have to have guiding truths that withstand that voice that always questions and dissects. For that, I need proof that is able to silence my voice.
    <br>
    <br>
    Should I ever reach the end of this, I may even put my findings in a single consistent document. For now, only this series of articles exist with each extending or modifying my corpus of understanding. They only make sense in context and all have to be read in order.
