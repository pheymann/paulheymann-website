  <blockquote>
    What does it mean to live a good and fulfilling life? For the largest part of mine, I was completely ignorant of that question. I was pulled along a path I didn’t choose by forces I didn’t understand. I set money and titles as the central goals and believed that with the next achievement, I would be happy and free of any worries. I was dedicated and driven. When everyone else went to parties in university I continued studying. When everyone went home after work and had a social life I continued working, and it paid off. I collected academic titles and earned increasingly more money. But nothing actually changed. Everything was just a new baseline and I was still not happy or free. Not even the birth of my first child changed that. It made it even worse because new worries were added on top of the old ones. After years along this bitter path finally, my mind rebelled and collapsed. Chaos encompassed me all of a sudden and from one day to the next there was nothing left for me but debilitating anxiety.
    <br>
    <br>
    During that time of chaos, I enamored myself with discipline and a patchwork of principles that let me wage war against myself, against my mind and body, to extinguish the dragon within me. They were the weapons and armor I used to finally gain victory. But luckily war was eventually over and these tools I choose reached the end of their usefulness. I could not go back to the principles I followed before. I realized that I was driven by a deeply ingrained lack of self-esteem which made me worry, fear, and reach for external validation. But I also intimately knew that none of the paths I had chosen before were right for me and so I had to face the question: What actually makes a good life?

  <p>
    That question I pose in my first article is the driving force behind this series. I try to uncover for myself the concepts of truth and good in the hope that when properly and rationally understood it may lead me to a better, maybe even a good life. And I try to do all that only with the tool of self-reflection, by observing experience itself to understand what it means to be. At least that is my goal and this series of essays shows that it doesn’t come easy to me. The first three articles reiterate a partially Humian and partially biological view and neither of them I properly understood at the time. Only when I identified this flaw in <a href="{% post_url reality-truth-and-the-good-life/2022-10-08-flaw-I-have-to-rethink-reality-and-ontology %}">Flaw: I have to rethink Reality and Ontology</a> did I put myself on a proper path toward an analysis with as few axioms and assumptions as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    This approach of writing what I know now and going from there makes this series a living representation of my current understanding and at the same time allows me to make progress, uncover my mistakes, and learn from them. In some sense, it is my personal style of meditation on what it means to be me.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
    <i>What comes next?</i>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time, continued change</li>
    <li>Memory</li>
    <li>Agency</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
  By now, I should have a good enough understanding of experienced reality to work out how truths exist within it, especially those which guide human existence.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Relation of empirical observations and a pure conscious experience.</li>
    <li>What it means to die.</li>
    <li>Decision-making and free will.</li>
    <li>What exactly is objectively true here?</li>
    <li>What is good?</li>
    <li>Where to find truths that lead to a good life?\</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>
    Whom do I have to convince? Only me. I have to have guiding truths that withstand that voice that always questions and dissects. For that, I need proof that is able to silence my voice.
    <br>
    <br>
    Should I ever reach the end of this, I may even put my findings in a single consistent document. For now, only this series of articles exist with each element extending or modifying my corpus of understanding.
